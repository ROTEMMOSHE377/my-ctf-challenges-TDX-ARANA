Challenge Description:
During a coffee break, your colleague, Boris, teased you and said that he managed to hack your computer earlier that day and planted a hidden file in it.
Since you always lock you computer when you leave, you suspect he did it using a network-related vulnerability. Luckily, company policy includes network traffic monitoring.
The NOC team agreed to provide you with access to the recorded traffic of your computer on the same morning.

Your goals are:
☛ Identify what Boris did to hack your computer.
☛ Find the content of the file that Boris planted on your computer.

Process:
When we start the challenge we will be presented with an open 'Wireshark' GUI with several hundreds if not more logs, one of which will contain the flag.
